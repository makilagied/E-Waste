# E-Waste

Welcome to E-Waste, a decentralized web3 platform developed by a team of 4 as part of the winning entry in the Filecoin Infinity Hackathon 2022. Our platform offers a practical solution to the growing problem of electronic waste by incentivizing responsible e-waste management. By collecting non-usable electronic devices from people and rewarding them for their efforts, we aim to promote the reuse and recycling of electronic devices while also conserving the environment. E-Waste is hosted on Filecoin and built on the principles of decentralization, transparency, and security.
